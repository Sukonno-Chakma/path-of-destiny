      <p><strong>Triss Merigold of Maribor</strong> is a powerful sorceress and a key member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, later the Lodge of Sorceresses. Known for her distinctive chestnut hair (often described as "crimson"), youthful appearance, and freckles, Triss is one of the youngest members of the magical community to attain the rank of sorceress. She earned the nickname "Fourteenth of the Hill" after being mistakenly declared dead following the Battle of Sodden Hill, where she was the fourteenth and last to be laid on the memorial mound.

                 Triss is characterized by her kindness, compassion, and occasional insecurity, which sets her apart from many of her more ruthless colleagues. She served as an advisor to King Foltest of Temeria and played a significant role in political affairs across the Northern Kingdoms. Her expertise in healing magic and potions is renowned throughout the Continent.

                 Triss maintains complex relationships with many key figures, including a romantic history with Geralt of Rivia, a friendship-turned-rivalry with Yennefer of Vengerberg, and a protective attitude toward Ciri, whom she helped care for at Kaer Morhen. Despite her gentle nature, Triss has proven herself capable of great courage and determination, particularly during the events of the Nilfgaardian Wars and the hunt for Ciri.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>Triss Merigold was born in Maribor and showed magical potential at a young age. She was trained at Aretuza, the famous academy for sorceresses on Thanedd Island, where she excelled in healing magic and alchemy. After completing her education, she became a court sorceress and advisor to King Foltest of Temeria, a position she held for many years.</p>
          
          <p>Triss fought valiantly at the Battle of Sodden Hill against Nilfgaardian forces, where she was severely injured and mistakenly declared dead. This earned her the nickname "Fourteenth of the Hill" as she was the fourteenth and last person laid on the memorial mound. Her survival and recovery were seen as miraculous.</p>
          
          <p>Triss became involved with Geralt of Rivia during his amnesia period, developing deep feelings for him despite his complicated history with Yennefer. She also played a significant role in Ciri's life, helping to care for her at Kaer Morhen and treating her with potions to control her emerging powers. Throughout the political turmoil on the Continent, Triss often found herself torn between her loyalties to her friends and her duties as a sorceress.</p>
