      <p><strong>Known as the White Wolf</strong>, Geralt of Rivia is a legendary witcher from the School of the Wolf, trained at the remote fortress of Kaer Morhen. Through the brutal Trial of the Grasses—an alchemical process that only a few children survive—he underwent mutations that granted him superhuman abilities, making him faster, stronger, and more resilient than ordinary men. His hair turned white from the additional experimental mutations he endured, earning him his iconic nickname.
                 Equipped with enhanced senses, remarkable combat skills, and knowledge of monster lore, Geralt travels the Path—a witcher's lonely journey—hunting dangerous creatures for coin. He wields two swords: steel for humans and non-magical beasts, and silver for supernatural monsters. Beyond his physical enhancements, he commands a limited form of magic known as Signs, simple but effective spells like Igni for fire and Quen for protection.

                 Despite his profession and mutations, Geralt often finds himself entangled in political intrigues, wars between kingdoms, and moral dilemmas that challenge his supposed neutrality. His story is deeply intertwined with those of Yennefer of Vengerberg, a powerful sorceress and his great love, and Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (Ciri), his adopted daughter with a destiny tied to the ancient Elder Blood. Throughout the Continent, Geralt is both celebrated as a protector and feared as a mutant, navigating a world that often shuns his kind while relying on his skills to survive the darkness that lurks in the wilderness.</p>
