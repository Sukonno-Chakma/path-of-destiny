      <p><strong>Vesemir</strong> is the oldest and most experienced witcher from the School of the Wolf, residing in the fortress of Kaer Morhen. As the sole surviving witcher who remembers the golden age of the witcher schools, he serves as a living repository of knowledge, tradition, and history. Though his exact age is unknown, he is believed to be several centuries old, having witnessed the rise and fall of the witcher profession.

                 Vesemir did not undergo the full Trial of the Grasses himself, as he was already a fencing instructor when the mutagenic procedures were developed. This means he lacks some of the enhanced abilities of other witchers, but he more than compensates with his vast experience, wisdom, and exceptional swordsmanship skills. He is responsible for training generations of witchers, including Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and later Ciri.

                 Despite his gruff exterior and often cynical humor, Vesemir possesses a deep paternal affection for his "boys" and shows unexpected tenderness toward Ciri, whom he treats as a granddaughter. He is the steadfast guardian of Kaer Morhen, maintaining the crumbling fortress as a sanctuary for witchers. His knowledge of monsters, combat techniques, and witcher lore is unparalleled, making him a respected figure even among those who generally distrust witchers.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>Vesemir's early life remains largely unknown, but he came to Kaer Morhen centuries ago as a fencing instructor, before the development of the Trial of the Grasses. When the mutagenic procedures were created, he was already too old to undergo them safely, so he never received the full suite of witcher mutations. Despite this, he became an accomplished witcher through skill and experience alone.</p>
          
          <p>Vesemir witnessed the heyday of the School of the Wolf, when Kaer Morhen trained dozens of new witchers each year. He survived the infamous attack on Kaer Morhen, when a mob enraged by anti-witcher propaganda stormed the fortress and killed most of the witchers and mages there. This event left him as one of the few survivors and the oldest living witcher of the Wolf School.</p>
          
          <p>In his later years, Vesemir became a father figure to the few remaining witchers who returned to Kaer Morhen each winter. He trained Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and others in the art of swordsmanship and monster hunting. When Ciri came to Kaer Morhen, he developed a grandfatherly affection for her and supported her training despite initial reservations about training a girl. Vesemir ultimately gave his life defending Ciri during the Battle of Kaer Morhen, sacrificing himself to save those he considered family.</p>
