      <p><strong>Dandelion</strong> (known as Jaskier in the original Polish books) is a famous bard, poet, and troubadour who is Geralt of Rivia's closest friend and constant companion. Despite their vastly different personalities and lifestyles, the witcher and the bard have formed an unlikely but enduring friendship that has lasted for decades. With his flamboyant clothing, charming personality, and exceptional musical talent, Dandelion is one of the most recognizable figures across the Northern Kingdoms.

                 Though he often appears as a frivolous womanizer concerned only with wine, women, and song, Dandelion possesses surprising depth and loyalty. He has repeatedly proven willing to risk his life for Geralt and their other friends, showing courage that belies his foppish exterior. His ballads and stories about Geralt's adventures have played a significant role in shaping the witcher's reputation throughout the Continent—for better and for worse.

                 Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts at Oxenfurt University, where he eventually became a professor, though he rarely stays in one place long enough to actually teach. His romantic escapades are legendary, having involved counts, baronesses, and even queens, though his most significant relationship was with the troubadour Priscilla. Through his travels with Geralt, Dandelion has witnessed and documented some of the most important events in the history of the Northern Kingdoms.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>Julian Alfred Pankratz was born in 1229, the son of Count de Lettenhove, which made him a viscount by birth. Despite his noble upbringing, he rejected the life of aristocracy to pursue his passion for music and poetry, adopting the stage name "Dandelion" (Jaskier in the original Polish). He studied at the prestigious Oxenfurt Academy, where he excelled in his studies and eventually earned a professorship, though he rarely exercised his teaching duties.</p>
          
          <p>Dandelion first met Geralt of Rivia in the town of Gulet, where the witcher saved him from an unpleasant situation. This began a decades-long friendship and partnership, with Dandelion accompanying Geralt on many of his adventures and immortalizing them in song. Their relationship is one of the most enduring friendships in the Witcher universe, despite their contrasting personalities—Geralt's stoic practicality versus Dandelion's flamboyant romanticism.</p>
          
          <p>Throughout his life, Dandelion has been involved in numerous historical events, often finding himself in trouble due to his romantic entanglements or loose tongue. He owned The Chameleon tavern in Novigrad for a time and maintained complicated relationships with many powerful figures across the Continent. Despite his apparent frivolity, Dandelion has repeatedly demonstrated loyalty and courage when his friends were in danger, proving that there's more to him than just a pretty face and a silver tongue.</p>
