  <h2>The Conjunction of the Spheres</h2>
  <p>Long ago, the fabric of reality tore and worlds collided in a cataclysm known as the Conjunction of the Spheres. Countless realms, each with their own laws of nature, overlapped for a brief, violent moment before drifting apart again. But when the dust settled, fragments of those alien worlds remained behind.

From that disaster came monsters—creatures with no place in the natural order of the Continent. Vampires, ghouls, wraiths, and worse spilled into forests and mountains, forcing humankind and elder races alike to confront nightmares that had never existed before.

Yet monsters were not the only legacy. The raw essence of other dimensions—what would come to be known as Chaos—lingered in the air, earth, and blood of the Continent. This was the birth of magic. To some, it was a blessing, a new force to harness for knowledge and power. To others, it was a curse that corrupted the world and those who dared wield it.

The Conjunction also seeded deeper mysteries: ancient portals hidden in ruins, unstable rifts that still bleed creatures between realms, and bloodlines imbued with otherworldly potential. Legends say Elder Blood itself is a direct inheritance of that moment, granting its bearers the ability to traverse time and space.

For the scholars of Ban Ard and the sorceresses of Aretuza, the Conjunction remains the ultimate riddle—an origin story of magic, monsters, and destiny itself. For the common folk, it is remembered in fearful whispers as the day the world was forever broken.</p>
