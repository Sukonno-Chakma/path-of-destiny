      <p><strong>Yennefer of Vengerberg</strong> is one of the most powerful and influential sorceresses on the Continent, known for her striking beauty, sharp intelligence, and formidable magical abilities. Born a hunchback in the town of Vengerberg, she was ostracized and abused by her parents before being sold to Aretuza, the famous academy for young sorceresses. There, under the guidance of Tissaia de Vries, she underwent painful magical transformations that corrected her physical deformities and unlocked her immense magical potential, though the experience left her unable to bear children—a source of lifelong pain and motivation.

                 Yennefer is characterized by her raven-black hair, violet eyes, and signature lilac and gooseberry perfume. She is fiercely independent, ambitious, and often perceived as cold or arrogant, but beneath her formidable exterior lies deep vulnerability, especially regarding her infertility and her complicated relationship with Geralt of Rivia. Their romance, bound by destiny through a djinn's wish, is passionate and tumultuous, marked by periods of intense connection and painful separation.

                 As a member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and later the Lodge of Sorceresses, Yennefer plays a significant role in the political landscape of the Continent, serving as an advisor to kings and participating in events that shape nations. Her life becomes irrevocably intertwined with Ciri, whom she comes to love as the daughter she could never have, fiercely protecting and mentoring her. Yennefer's journey is one of power, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of what she desires most—motherhood and true love.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>Yennefer was born in 1173 during the Belleteyn festival in the town of Vengerberg, the capital of Aedirn. 
          Born with a hunchback and other physical deformities, she suffered abuse from her father before being sold for a pittance to Tissaia de Vries, 
          who recognized her magical potential and took her to Aretuza, the school for sorceresses on Thanedd Island.</p>
          
          <p>At Aretuza, Yennefer underwent a painful magical transformation that straightened her spine and made her incredibly beautiful, 
          though the process left her infertile. This loss would become a driving force throughout her life. After graduating, 
          she became a powerful sorceress and eventually an advisor to King Demavend III of Aedirn.</p>
          
          <p>Yennefer's life changed forever when she met Geralt of Rivia in Rinde, where a djinn's wish bound their destinies together. 
          Their tumultuous relationship would span decades, marked by passion, separation, and eventual reconciliation. 
          Later, she would develop a maternal relationship with Ciri, training her in magic and protecting her from numerous threats, 
          ultimately becoming the mother figure Ciri desperately needed.</p>
