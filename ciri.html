      <p><strong>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon</strong>, better known as Ciri, is the Princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Duny, and the granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. Her life was forever changed when Geralt of Rivia invoked the Law of Surprise after saving Duny's life, unknowingly claiming the unborn Ciri as his child surprise. This bound their destinies together long before they would meet.

                 Ciri possesses the rare Elder Blood (Hen Ichaer), a genetic lineage that grants her incredible powers, including the ability to move between worlds and times. After the fall of Cintra to Nilfgaard, Ciri became a target of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, who sought to control her power and bloodline. She escaped and eventually found her way to Kaer Morhen, where she began witcher training under Geralt and Vesemir.

                 Her journey is one of survival, identity, and embracing her destiny. Ciri is trained as a witcher but also studied magic under Yennefer of Vengerberg, who became a mother figure to her. She is fierce, independent, and resilient, having survived countless trials including the deadly pursuit of the Wild Hunt. Ciri's story is central to the fate of the Continent, as her powers could either save or destroy the world as she navigates her roles as a witcher, sorceress, and heir to multiple thrones.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-content">
          <p>Ciri was born in 1252 or 1253 during the Belleteyn festival, as the only child of Pavetta and Duny (who was later revealed to be Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard). 
          Her birth was surrounded by prophecy due to her Elder Blood lineage, which traces back to the elven sage Lara Dorren. 
          As a child, she survived the massacre of Cintra when Nilfgaard invaded, becoming one of the few members of the royal family to escape.</p>
          
          <p>After living as a refugee, Ciri eventually found her way to Kaer Morhen, where she began training as a witcher under Geralt's guidance. 
          She later studied magic at the Temple of Melitele and under Yennefer's tutelage at Aretuza. 
          Her unique abilities made her a target for various factions including the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Wild Hunt, leading to years on the run across worlds and times.</p>
          
          <p>Ciri's journey culminated in her confrontation with the White Frost, a dimensional threat that she was destined to stop. 
          Her story represents the struggle between destiny and choice, as she navigated her multiple identities as princess, witcher, and bearer of the Elder Blood.</p>
